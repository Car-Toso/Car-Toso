#### **1. Overview**

This project analyzes user activity and sleep patterns from Bellabeat smart devices, aiming to extract actionable insights for wellness improvement. The analysis was performed using **BigQuery** and **Tableau**, following a structured end-to-end process.

***
#### **2. Data & Preparation**
- Imported daily activity, sleep day, and weight log info datasets.
- Handled blank cells, formatted columns, and ensured consistency.
- Created views to organize data, remove duplicates, and round numeric values.
- Merged activity and sleep datasets for a comprehensive analysis.

***
#### **3. Feature Creation & Analysis**
- Categorized activity levels based on active minutes.
- Calculated average steps per user, identifying those exceeding 8000 and 10000 daily steps.
- Measured sedentary time and sleep duration to identify areas for improvement.
- Analyzed device usage patterns across participants.

***
#### **4. Visualizations & Key insights**

1. **Activity Category – Vertical bar chart:** *32% of records are sedentary*, showing predominantly low-intensity activity.
2. **App Usage – Donut Chart:** *93.5% of users are highly active within the app*, indicating strong engagement.
3. **Average Total Steps & Average Total Minutes of Sleep – Grouped Bar Chart by Day of the Week:** *Only 2 days* exceed 8,000 steps; none reach 10,000. Average sleep is below 8 hours daily, revealing insufficient rest.
4. **Average Total Steps vs. Time in Bed – Combined Bar & Line Chart:** Higher step counts correlate with longer time in bed, suggesting users recover more after active days.
5. **Average Total Steps per User – Bar Chart:** Out of 33 users, *7 exceed 10,000 steps* and *14 exceed 8,000 steps*, showing that *less than half of users reach the level suggested by research for health benefits*.
This highlights that while some users are highly active, *most are below the recommended daily activity thresholds*, indicating potential opportunities for engagement or personalized activity goals.
6. **Lightly, Fairly, and Very Active Minutes vs. Weekday – Grouped Bar Chart:** Lightly active minutes peak on Fridays and Saturdays, reflecting increased weekend activity that could inform targeted wellness recommendations.

***
#### **5. Recommendations Based on Key Findings**

1. **Increase Data Sample Size:** 📊 Increase the number of users and tracking duration to improve reliability and reveal deeper patterns.
2. **Encourage Daily Activity:** 🚶‍♂️🏃‍♀️ Use personalized reminders or gamified challenges to reduce sedentary behavior and help more users reach step goals.
3. **Promote Consistent Sleep:** 😴🛌 Offer guidance and reminders to promote consistent, adequate rest.
4. **Leverage Positive Activity Patterns:** 🎉📈 Encourage weekend activity and balance it with recovery insights.
5. **Personalized Engagement Opportunities:** 🧩💡 Segment users by activity level to deliver targeted wellness recommendations

#### **1. Overview**

This project focuses on the fictional company AdventureWorks (a global cycling equipment manufacturer), simulating a real-world business intelligence scenario: transforming raw data into actionable insights for management. The goal is to monitor and analyze key KPIs such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns, comparing performance across regions, products, and key customers through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
This project presents a sales performance analysis for **Adventure Works**, developed during the *Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence* course by Maven Academy.


#### **2. Data & Preparation**


The dataset consists of CSV files including transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.
You can find the dataset at the following link:  
[AdventureWorks Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/adventure-works)

Data preparation steps included:

- Standardizing column names and correcting capitalization for uniformity.
- Splitting or merging columns to create more granular calculated fields.
- Importing all tables into Power BI’s relational model, ensuring clean, structured, and analysis-ready data.
Additional cleaning and transformation:
- Handling missing or blank values, removing duplicates, and correcting date, number, and text formats.
- Merging related datasets (e.g., sales + returns) and adding calculated columns for segmentation and deeper analysis.

#### **3. Feature Creation & Analysis**

Once the data was clean, relationships between tables were defined in Power BI.
Key calculations and features:

- DAX measures for core KPIs: Total Sales, Total Orders, Profit, Return Rate.
- Profit margin as (Profit / Sales) to evaluate performance by product/region.
- Period-over-period comparisons using CALCULATE() and DATEADD() to track recent growth (e.g., 10, 90 days).

Segmentation and analysis:

- Customer segmentation by year and continent to study trends over time.
- Regional aggregations to compare sales, profit, and growth across markets.
- Product classification by category and tier according to revenue and margin to highlight top and low performers.
- Dynamic “What‑if” parameters to simulate price adjustments and estimate potential impact on profitability.

#### **4. Visualizations & Key Insights**

Multiple dashboards were developed, each with a specific focus:
- Sales Overview: global KPI summary (Total Sales, Profit, Return Rate) with period and region filters.
- Regional Analysis: performance by continent and country, highlighting top markets and growth opportunities.
- Customer Insights: customer segmentation by year and continent, spend distribution, and behavior patterns.
- Product Performance: evaluation of product categories by revenue and profit margin to identify top and lagging products.

Key findings:
- Revenue of ~US $24.9 M with profit of ~US $10 M across ~25,000 orders; return rate of 2.17%, indicating reasonable operational efficiency.
- The Accessories category had the highest order volume (~17,000), driven by Water Bottles, the top-selling product.
- Tires and Tubes showed the strongest demand, making them key products in the sales mix.
- Regionally, the US leads sales, followed by Australia, suggesting strong penetration in North America and Oceania.
- A high-value customer, Maurice Shan, placed 6 orders totaling US $12.4 K, showing the impact of top clients.

#### **5. Recommendations Based on Key Findings**

- Focus on top-performing regions (US, Australia) to strengthen marketing and distribution strategies.
- Expand the Accessories category, particularly Water Bottles, to capitalize on high demand.
- Explore bundling or cross-selling strong products like Tires and Tubes to leverage key revenue drivers.
- Implement retention strategies for high-value customers (like Maurice Shan) to increase long-term revenue.
