#### **1. Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive 360° analysis of **Olist**, the largest department **store marketplace in Brazil**. By transforming raw transactional data into a four-stage analytical ecosystem, this dashboard enables executive-level decision-making focused on revenue health, regional performance, and strategic growth. The analysis identifies key drivers of success and critical areas for risk mitigation.

#### **2. Data & Preparation**

The project follows a robust end-to-end data engineering pipeline to ensure data integrity and optimal performance in **Power BI**. The raw dataset from Olist was processed using **PostgreSQL**, moving from unstructured raw files to a refined Star Schema.

#### *Database Engineering & ETL Flow*
To maintain a scalable and clean environment, the following SQL-based workflow was executed:

* **Schema Definition (01_schema)**: Created a structured environment in PostgreSQL to host transactional data, ensuring correct data types for financial accuracy.
* **Raw Data Ingestion (02_load_raw)**: Successfully migrated CSV files into the database, handling encoding and large-scale ingestion.
* **Integrity Enforcement (03_constraints_fix)**: Defined Primary and Foreign Keys to establish relational integrity and prevent data duplication.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (04_eda)**: Conducted deep SQL exploration to identify outliers, missing values, and seasonal trends within the Brazilian e-commerce landscape.
* **Normalization & Business Views (05_normalization_views)**: Instead of loading raw tables, I developed optimized **SQL Views**. This layer encapsulates business logic, pre-aggregates financial metrics, and serves as a "Single Source of Truth" for Power BI.

<p align="center">
<img src="Assets/OL5.png" width="600" alt="imagen 5">
</p>

#### *Data Modeling*
The final data architecture was implemented as a **Star Schema** in Power BI to maximize DAX efficiency:

* Fact Tables: Centered around fact_orders and fact_order_payments to track every financial transaction.
* Dimension Tables: Developed comprehensive dimensions for dim_products, dim_customers, dim_sellers, and dim_geography.
* Calendar Architecture: Established a dual-calendar system—a standard linked Calendar Table for core time intelligence and a Disconnected Calendar to drive the dynamic time-window switching (1W, 1M, TY, etc.) without disrupting model filters.

<p align="center">
<img src="Assets/OL6.png" width="600" alt="imagen 6">
</p>

#### **3. Feature Creation & Analysis**

This project showcases advanced analytical capabilities by transforming raw data into actionable intelligence through complex DAX modeling and interactive UX design.

#### *Strategic Business Logic: The Yearly Health Score*

To provide an instantaneous diagnostic of business performance, I developed a weighted **Health Index (0 to 1)**. This composite metric enables stakeholders to move beyond looking at isolated KPIs by providing a holistic "Business Pulse":

* Weighted Components: The score is calculated by assigning strategic importance to different operational pillars: **Net Revenue (40%)**, **On-Time Delivery (25%)**, **Customer Volume (20%)**, and **Average Review Scores (15%)**.

* DAX Implementation: Used normalized variables to scale different units (currency, percentages, and integers) into a unified scoring system, displayed via a custom Gauge Chart for immediate visual impact.

#### *Dynamic Analysis Framework*
* Multi-Metric Selector & Interactive Bookmarks: Instead of static reports, I implemented a custom Metric Selection panel. By combining Disconnected Tables with SWITCH logic and Bookmarks, the dashboard allows users to toggle the entire visual environment between 6 different KPIs (Gross Revenue, AOV, Cancellation Rate, etc.), ensuring specific chart types are optimized for each metric without cluttering the UI.
* Custom Time Windows: To solve the limitation of standard date slicers, I developed a Time Intelligence Selector. This feature allows users to "zoom" into specific intervals: 1W, 1M, 3M, TY (This Year), LY (Last Year), and ALL. This was achieved using a disconnected calendar table to drive the minimum and maximum date boundaries within a CALCULATE filter context.
* Variable Moving Averages: To identify real growth trends amidst daily transactional noise, I created a Flexible Moving Average tool. Users can choose between 3, 7, 14, or 30-day windows, utilizing AVERAGEX and DATESINPERIOD to smooth volatility based on the required level of granularity.


#### **4. Visualizations & Key insights**


The analytical journey is organized into four specialized dashboards, moving from high-level summaries to granular, actionable recommendations.

#### *Dashboard 1 & 2: Performance & Drivers*
* Executive Overview: A comprehensive 360° view of the business, highlighting a Gross Revenue of R$ 15.84M and an On-Time Delivery (OTD) rate of 91.9%.
* Performance Drivers: Utilizes interactive bookmarks to isolate top-performing categories (like Health & Beauty and Watches) and regional powerhouses like Sao Paulo.

#### *Dashboard 3: Diagnostic Insights (Advanced DAX)*
This section utilizes the "Health Score" logic to identify specific business risks:

* **Revenue Integrity (Funnel Analysis)**: The ecosystem demonstrates high operational efficiency with a **97% revenue retention rate**. Leakage from cancellations (R$ 0.11M) and pipeline losses (R$ 0.32M) remains below 3%, suggesting highly effective order fulfillment.
* **Customer Acquisition & Retention**: A "Growth Stagnation Alert" was identified in 2018 as customer acquisition plateaued at **~20K per quarter**. With near-zero retention, new acquisitions only offset churn, leading to a market saturation risk.
* **Operational Polarization**: Despite a strong 4.09 average review score, a high volume of **1-star reviews** reveals significant operational friction that threatens brand reputation.
* **Logistics Efficiency**: The analysis of "Promised vs. Actual" delivery dates shows a massive safety buffer. Tightening these estimates presents a **Competitive Edge Opportunity** to increase sales conversion without risking reliability.

#### **5. Recommendations Based on Key Findings**

To ensure long-term sustainability and margin expansion, the following strategic actions are recommended:

**Immediate (High Priority): Risk Mitigation**
* **Root-Cause Audit**: Conduct an immediate investigation into the R$ 1.27M revenue drop observed between Q2 and Q3 2018.
* **Friction Reduction**: Address the source of 1-star reviews to halt the customer decline observed in the latter half of 2018.

**Recommended: Growth & Retention**
* **Loyalty Program Implementation**: Shift focus from pure acquisition to customer retention. Developing a repeat-buyer incentive is critical to break the "plateau" observed in the 2018 customer base.
* **Logistics Optimization**: Tighten delivery date estimates. Reducing the "promised buffer" will improve the customer experience and competitive positioning against faster shippers.

**Suggested: Geographic Expansion**
* **Regional De-risking**: Reallocate 15% of the marketing budget from the saturated Sao Paulo market to **high-AOV clusters in the Northeast (Pernambuco/Bahia)**. This will increase overall margins without scaling logistics overhead.
